A reminder that the deadline to send me your clicker ID for the first bonus mark is 10am Wed May 6th. (Even if you get your clicker after that, please send the ID as you are still eligible for bonus marks for participating in the clicker quizzes in the lectures.)
May 4th: The teams are set! Everyone should have received an e-mail with their project team number (1 to 6) and their team members and their e-mails. If anyone joins the course late or decides to drop the course, please let me know.
April 30th: Here is the information you need to create your account for the SCE labs (including AA508): http://sce.carleton.ca/labs/accountcreation.html.
April 27th: This course will involve a project done in teams of five. If you already know who you would like to work with, you may send me the names. The deadline for choosing your team is 8pm Tue May 5th. Those who do not e-mail me with team-mates will be assigned to a team. The first team meeting with a TA is during the lab on Wed May 6th.
April 23rd: The course outline, supplementary references, and term calendar have been posted above.
April 23rd: There is a lab on the first day of classes.
April 23rd: We will be using TurningPoint "clickers" in the SYSC 3303 lectures to get your interactive feedback as the term progresses. Take your student card to the CUOL office in Loeb D299 to sign out a clicker for the term (this is free of charge, as long as you return the clicker at the end of term). If possible, do this before the first lecture. Otherwise, you will have a chance during the break in the middle of the first class. Students who participate in the clicker quizzes during the lectures will receive bonus marks. For your first bonus mark, please use your Carleton e-mail account to send me your clicker's 6 hex digit device id (usually right below or above the clicker barcode (not the Carleton barcode)) by 10am Wed May 6th.
April 23rd: For those who want to get a head start on the course, the second assignment will involve summarizing a paper or article (journal, web, newspaper, etc.) on any topic related to real-time concurrent systems. If you send me a pdf version or link to the article that you are interested in and I approve it, then you can start your summary now. Note that you will have the option of presenting your summary in class towards the end of term for bonus markby 10am Wed May 6th.
THIS IS THE END
